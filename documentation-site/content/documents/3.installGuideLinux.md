# Installation Guide (Linux)

Download both `libnapc-linux.tar.gz` and `napc.h` from the <a href="../releases.html" target="_blank">releases<a> page.

Then unpack the tar archive and run the `./INSTALL.sh` script like so:

```shell
$ mkdir libnapc
$ tar -xzvf libnapc-linux.tar.gz -C libnapc
$ cd libnapc && ./INSTALL.sh
```

The `./INSTALL.sh` script will compile and generate a static library with the name `libnapc.a` in the working directory.

Move the `napc.h` header file inside `libnapc` (the folder you just created).

Then you can use libnapc like so:

```
gcc -I./ main.c -L./ -lnapc
```

`-I./` tells `gcc` to include the current working directory to the system header include path.

This makes `#include <napc.h>` work.

`-L/` tells `gcc` to add the current working directory to the library search path.

## Permanent installation

To make installation "permanent":

- move `libnapc.a` to `/usr/local/lib/libnapc.a`.
- move `napc.h` to `/usr/local/include/napc.h`.

After this, you should be able to use libnapc from anywhere like this:

```
gcc main.c -lnapc
```
