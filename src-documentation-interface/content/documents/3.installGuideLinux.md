# Installation Guide (Linux)

Download `libnapc-linux.tar.gz` from the <a href="../releases.html" target="_blank">releases<a> page.

Then unpack the tar archive and run the `./compile.sh` script like so:

```shell
$ mkdir libnapc
$ tar -xzvf libnapc-linux.tar.gz -C libnapc
$ cd libnapc && ./compile.sh
```

The `./compile.sh` script will compile the source files and ultimately generate a static library with the name `libnapc.a` in the working directory.

Then you can use libnapc like so:

```shell
gcc -I./ main.c -L./ -lnapc
```

`-I./` tells `gcc` to add the current working directory to the system's header search paths.

This makes `#include <napc.h>` work.

`-L./` tells `gcc` to add the current working directory to the library search path.

This makes `-lnapc` work.

## Permanent installation

To make installation more permanent, you can either run `install.sh` or do the following steps as root:

- move `libnapc.a` to `/usr/local/lib/libnapc.a`.
- move `napc.h` to `/usr/local/include/napc.h`.

After this, you should be able to use libnapc from anywhere like this:

```shell
gcc main.c -lnapc
```
