Thank you very much for checking out the documentation of [libnapc](https://libnapc.nap-software.com/)! ðŸŽ‰

This library came into existence to support any projects written in C by nap.software.

Its split up into three parts:

- Core library (basic functionality, basic HAL)
- Hardware independent modules:
  - DNS
  - Cryptographic functions (SHA256-HMAC and AES-256)
  - Buffer management (Writer, Reader)
  - Random byte generation
  - String parsing
- Hardware dependent modules:
  - Networking (UDP)
  - FileSystem

It provides HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) so that applications written in it can be run both on Arduino and Linux.
